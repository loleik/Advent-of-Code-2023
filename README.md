# Advent-of-Code-2023
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) written in Rust.
I do intend to go back and rewrite some days I'm particularly unhappy with, but it all works unless stated otherwise.

## Notes
+ Day 12 part 2 is not complete. As of right now I don't see any way I can do it. I am trying to understand the dynamic programming approach but I am making no progress at all.
+ Day 13 Part 2 is not complete.
+ Got day 14 part 2 by just getting the ~1000th because I was curious if it actually worked. Struggling to get code that correctly finds the cycle length and the value properly... 
+ Day 15 part 2 is not complete. Works for test input but gives a different answer every time for real input...
